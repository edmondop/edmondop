### Hi there 👋

Edmondo (recipe for four people): 🧑‍🍳
- Take a base of core software engineering
- Add two scoops of distributed systems 
- Add three chopped ounces of Site Reliability Engineering
- Season with data engineering tomato sauce  🍅
- Mix with pragmatism and passion for business impact 

 Can be served hot or cold, in large organizations or at small dinners, in deep technical discussions and high level strategic roadmaps.

These are my [assistant code reviewers](https://github.com/reviewdog/reviewdog)
