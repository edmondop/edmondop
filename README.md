### Hi there 👋

Edmondo (recipe for four people): 🧑‍🍳
- Take a base of core software engineering
- Add two scoops of distributed systems 
- Add three chopped ounces of Site Reliability Engineering
- Season with data engineering tomato sauce  🍅
- Mix with pragmatism

 Can be served hot or cold, in large organizations or at small dinners, in deep technical discussions and high level strategic roadmaps.
